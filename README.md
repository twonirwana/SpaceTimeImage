Space Time Image
================

A simple jupiter notebook to create an image of the planetary position at a specific time.
To make the image smaller the distance from the sun is forth root and a linear factor.
The size of the planets is calculated with square root and a linear factor from the planets radii.
Optionally it is possible to add the planetary symbols.
